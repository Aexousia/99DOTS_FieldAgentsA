# 99DOTS_FieldAgentsA
Created the first of its kind simulation queuing model for 99DOTS and quantitatively analyzed various aspects of its Field Visits to prevent maximum deaths due to non-adherence. 99DOTS is a low-cost approach for monitoring and improving TB medication adherence funded by Gates Foundation, UK Aid and US Aid. We created a real-life replica for the proposed provision of field visits to patients who show low adherence and devised ways to estimate various aspects of the provision- ● Estimated the amount of waiting time and the pending number of patients that we will have against the number of patients we assign to one Field Officer. ● Predicted the change in waiting time and dosing implementation due to change in factors that are under our control. ● Estimated the factors that can help improve dosing implementation in the model and thereby play a role in the eradication of the disease.
